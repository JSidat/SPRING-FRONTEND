## Introduction

The objectives of thhis project was to create CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application by incorporating Spring (Java framework) for creating the backend, and Javascript, HTML and CSS for the frontend. This README will act as documentation for the project and how the different components of the project came together through project planning, code execution and testinng and evaluating.   

## Project Scope

The scope of the project outlines the minimum requirements for successful completion of the deliverable which will help assess our development against the SFIA marking framework.

* Project tracking and planning was carried out via a kanban style board, allowing the documentation of user stories, product backlog and progression. The board for this project can be found here.

* Use of the feature-branch model for optimal version control, allowing for a safe and effective way of making changes to the source code. 

* A relational database used for the for the persistence of data.

* A functional application created using Java as the OOP language, following best practices and design principles.

* A front-end with an integrated API for the application that allows users to create, read, update and delete.

* Test suite with maximum coverage and automated testing for validatio of the application.
